# USD/JPY Exchange Rate Prediction using LSTM with Economic Indicators

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the USD/JPY exchange rate using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model. The model is trained on a dataset that includes daily financial data, such as currency pairs (EUR/USD, GBP/USD), Treasury yields (10Y and 30Y), and various US economic indicators like interest rates, inflation rates, unemployment rates, and GDP growth rates.

## Data Sources

The data used in this project is sourced from the following:
- **Yahoo Finance**: For daily FX rates (EUR/USD, GBP/USD) and Treasury yields (10Y and 30Y).
- **FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data)**: For US economic indicators, including:
    - **US Interest Rate** (Federal Funds Rate)
    - **US Inflation Rate** (Consumer Price Index)
    - **US Unemployment Rate**
    - **US GDP Growth Rate**

## Data Preprocessing

### 1. Data Collection
- **Daily FX Rates and Treasury Yields**: Data was fetched using the Yahoo Finance API.
- **Economic Indicators**: Data was fetched from FRED, with different frequencies (monthly, quarterly) compared to the daily financial data.

### 2. Data Alignment and Filling
- Economic indicators, which are reported monthly or quarterly, were forward-filled to align them with the daily frequency of FX rates and Treasury yields.
- Missing values were filled using the forward fill (`ffill`) method to ensure continuity in the dataset.

### 3. Feature Engineering
- **Lagged Features**: Lagged versions of all features (FX rates, Treasury yields, and economic indicators) were created to capture temporal dependencies.
- **Lag Period**: A 5-day lag was used to generate lagged features.

## Model Training

### 1. Model Selection
- An LSTM model was chosen due to its ability to capture sequential dependencies in time-series data.
- The model was designed with one or more LSTM layers, followed by dense layers to output the predicted USD/JPY exchange rate.

### 2. Hyperparameter Tuning
- A grid search with time-series cross-validation was performed to optimize the following hyperparameters:
    - Number of LSTM units
    - Number of LSTM layers
    - Dropout rate
    - Optimizer (Adam, RMSprop)
    - Batch size and number of epochs

### 3. Training and Testing
- The model was trained on data up to 2023.
- The 2024 data (up to today) was used as the test set to evaluate the model's performance.

## Evaluation and Results

### Model Performance
- The model's predictions were compared against the actual USD/JPY rates for 2024.
- The inclusion of economic indicators aimed to improve the model’s ability to predict USD/JPY by providing additional macroeconomic context.

### Observations
- Visualizations were created to compare the predicted and actual USD/JPY exchange rates.
- Economic indicators were plotted to analyze their trends and potential impacts on the USD/JPY exchange rate.

## Future Work

### Potential Improvements
- **Additional Features**: Consider incorporating more global economic indicators, or other financial instruments like stock indices or commodity prices.
- **Model Complexity**: Experiment with more complex models such as GRUs or Transformer models.
- **Alternative Lag Structures**: Explore different lag periods or dynamic lagging based on market conditions.
